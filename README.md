🌳 Roots of Eternity

A 2D Top-Down Soulslike RPG set in the shadow of the World Tree, Terrathraen.

📖 Overview

Roots of Eternity is a 2D top-down action RPG inspired by Soulslike combat and world design.
You awaken beneath Terrathraen, the Seed of Eternity, a colossal World Tree whose branches form the six elemental planes of existence.
Each root and branch connects worlds through ancient Plane Gates — remnants of divine creation now corrupted by wyrms and decay.

Forge your destiny as the Seed God’s chosen champion, wielding the mythical Rootforged Blade, Veythraal — a living sword infused with the Roots themselves.

🌍 Lore Summary
The World Tree — Terrathraen

Terrathraen’s roots and branches form six interconnected Elemental Planes:

🔥 Fire

❄️ Ice

🌪️ Air

🌱 Earth

⚡ Lightning

🌊 Water

The Roots of Eternity (Plane Gates)

Each Root connects two planes — gateways between realms shaped by their elements:

Gate	Connection	Title
🌊 The Well	Earth → Water	Passage through Verdros to Tethramar
🔥 The Eternal Flame	Ice → Fire	Passage through Norgheim to Karethkar
⚡ The Maelstrom	Air → Lightning	Passage through Vaelwyr to Solthrae
The Rootforged Blade — Veythraal

Forged by Thraenwyr, the Dryad Sage of the Isle of Thalen.

Contains 8 elemental stone slots (Thraenites):

1 tip slot (Death Stone — missing)

1 handle slot (Life Stone)

6 interchangeable slots along the blade

Acts as the player’s key to balance the planes and awaken the memory of the Seed God’s champion.
